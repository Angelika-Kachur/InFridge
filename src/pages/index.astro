	{/*
		client:load is an Astro directive that tells Astro:
		"This component needs JavaScript — hydrate it immediately when the page loads."

		Other options you could use:
		- client:visible — hydrate only when the component scrolls into view (lazy)
		- client:idle — hydrate once the browser is idle (after initial page load)
		- No directive — renders as static HTML with zero JS (what the other pages do)

		We use client:load here because the Calculator is above the fold and
		the form needs to be interactive immediately.
